## Database Architecture

### **Database Schema**

#### **maintenance_tasks Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.maintenance_tasks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  equipment TEXT NOT NULL,
  equipment_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('scheduled', 'unscheduled', 'inspection', 'repair')),
  status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('upcoming', 'overdue', 'completed', 'in-progress')) DEFAULT 'upcoming',
  due_date DATE NOT NULL,
  completed_date DATE,
  assigned_to TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  priority TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (priority IN ('low', 'medium', 'high')) DEFAULT 'medium',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now())
);
```

#### **Performance Indexes**
```sql
-- Optimize common query patterns
CREATE INDEX maintenance_tasks_user_id_idx ON maintenance_tasks(user_id);
CREATE INDEX maintenance_tasks_status_idx ON maintenance_tasks(status);
CREATE INDEX maintenance_tasks_due_date_idx ON maintenance_tasks(due_date);
CREATE INDEX maintenance_tasks_equipment_id_idx ON maintenance_tasks(equipment_id);
CREATE INDEX maintenance_tasks_assigned_to_idx ON maintenance_tasks(assigned_to);
```

#### **Row Level Security (RLS)**
```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.maintenance_tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- User-specific data access policies
CREATE POLICY "Maintenance tasks are viewable by owners."
  ON maintenance_tasks FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own maintenance tasks."
  ON maintenance_tasks FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own maintenance tasks."
  ON maintenance_tasks FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own maintenance tasks."
  ON maintenance_tasks FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## Technical Implementation

### **Frontend Architecture**

#### **Component Structure**
- **Maintenance.tsx:** Main page component with full database integration
- **MaintenanceListView.tsx:** Task list display with filtering capabilities
- **MaintenanceCalendarView.tsx:** Calendar-based task visualization
- **MaintenanceForm.tsx:** Task creation and editing interface
- **MaintenanceTaskItem.tsx:** Individual task card component with actions

#### **Service Layer Implementation**
```typescript
export class MaintenanceService {
  // Core CRUD operations
  async getUserMaintenanceTasks(userId: string, filter?: MaintenanceTaskFilter): Promise<DatabaseListResponse<MaintenanceTask>>
  async createMaintenanceTask(userId: string, task: MaintenanceTaskInsert): Promise<DatabaseResponse<MaintenanceTask>>
