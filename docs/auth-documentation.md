# Authentication Documentation

## Introduction

This document serves as the main entry point for all authentication-related documentation in the FarmSafe application. It provides links to detailed documentation on specific aspects of the authentication system.

## Authentication Components

The authentication system in FarmSafe is built on Supabase Auth and consists of several interconnected components:

1. **User Authentication** - Registration, login, and session management
2. **User Profiles** - Extended user data specific to the application
3. **Security Measures** - Row Level Security and other protection mechanisms
4. **UI Components** - Forms and user interfaces for authentication actions

## Documentation Index

### Core Documentation

1. [Authentication System](./authentication-system.md) - Overview of the entire authentication system
2. [Registration Flow](./registration-flow.md) - Detailed explanation of the user registration process
3. [User Profiles](./user-profiles.md) - Documentation on the profiles system and database structure

### Implementation Details

- The authentication system is implemented using Supabase Auth
- User interfaces are built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS
- Database security is implemented using Postgres Row Level Security

## Key Files

- `src/components/AuthProvider.tsx` - Authentication state and function provider
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication context definition
- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` - Supabase client configuration
- `src/pages/Signup.tsx` - Registration form
- `src/pages/Login.tsx` - Login form
- `supabase/setup.sql` - Database schema and security policies

## Getting Started

To understand the authentication system:

1. Start with the [Authentication System](./authentication-system.md) overview
2. Review the [Registration Flow](./registration-flow.md) for a deep dive into how users are created
3. Explore [User Profiles](./user-profiles.md) to understand how user data is structured

## Development Guidelines

When modifying the authentication system:

1. **Security First** - Always consider security implications of changes
2. **Type Safety** - Maintain TypeScript types for all database interactions
3. **User Experience** - Ensure error messages are clear and helpful
4. **Consistency** - Follow established patterns for authentication flows
5. **Testing** - Test all authentication flows thoroughly

## Troubleshooting

For common authentication issues, refer to the Troubleshooting section in the [Authentication System](./authentication-system.md) documentation.
