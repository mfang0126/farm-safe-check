### **Data Fields Stored**
```typescript
{
  id: UUID (auto-generated)
  user_id: UUID (linked to authenticated user)
  type: string (equipment category)
  make_model: string (manufacturer and model)
  operator: string (assigned operator name)
  last_inspection: date
  next_inspection: date
  purchase_date: date
  status: enum ('Passed', 'Needs Maintenance', 'Failed')
  safety_features: string[] (array of selected features)
  notes: text (optional comments)
  created_at: timestamp
  updated_at: timestamp
}
```
