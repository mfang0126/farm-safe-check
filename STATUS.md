- ✅ **Code Quality**: Fixed React Hooks usage to comply with rules (moved hooks before conditional returns)
- ✅ **User Experience**: Enhanced visual feedback and interaction smoothness

#### Risk Area UI Restoration to Previous Design - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Successfully restored previous UI design** while preserving all modern functionality and database integration
- ✅ **Header Structure**: Restored clean header design with "Risk Area Management" title outside tabs
- ✅ **Manage Zones Tab**: 
  - Restored "Zone Information Management" section header
  - Restored detailed zone cards with comprehensive information display
  - Restored 4 vertical action buttons: "View Details", "Edit Info", "View on Map", "Manage Plan"
  - Restored action plan inline display with status indicators
  - Restored incident tooltips and comprehensive zone information
  - Restored proper location display with "Location:" label
- ✅ **View Map Tab**:
  - Restored "Zone Position Management" header and description
  - Restored proper button layout: "Add Zone to Map" and "Edit Positions"
  - Restored Risk Levels legend with color indicators (now positioned top-right)
  - Maintained all map functionality and controls
- ✅ **Modal Components**: Updated to work with new/previous UI structure
- ✅ **Database Functionality**: All CRUD operations, action plans, and data persistence fully preserved
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Fixed all TypeScript linting errors and improved type definitions

#### UI Bug Fix - Header Duplication Fixed
- ✅ Fixed duplicated headers in Risk Area Management page
- ✅ Removed redundant main header, kept tab-specific headers only
- ✅ Improved visual consistency and eliminated confusion

#### Risk Area Database Integration - COMPLETED
- ✅ Applied Supabase migration for `farm_maps` and `risk_zones` tables
- ✅ Updated Supabase types with proper enum support for risk levels
- ✅ Successfully tested Risk Area feature functionality
- ✅ Verified database integration works correctly

#### Database Migration Applied
- Applied migration: `20250128_create_farm_map_and_risk_zones.sql`
- Created tables:
  - `farm_maps`: Stores farm layout information
  - `risk_zones`: Stores risk area definitions with proper relationships
- Added `risk_level` enum with values: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user data isolation
- Updated TypeScript types to match database schema

#### Testing Results
- ✅ Risk Area page loads successfully with restored UI
- ✅ "Add Risk Zone" modal opens without errors
- ✅ Form validation works correctly
- ✅ Database insertion successful (tested with existing zones)
- ✅ Data displays correctly in the restored UI format
- ✅ All 4 action buttons work correctly: View Details, Edit Info, View on Map, Manage Plan
- ✅ Action plan management functionality preserved
- ✅ Zone positioning and editing fully functional
- ✅ Success notifications work as expected

### Features Working
- User authentication and authorization
- Dashboard navigation
- Equipment management
- Checklists system
- Maintenance scheduling
- **Risk Area Management** (with restored previous UI design + database integration)

### Technical Implementation
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- UI Components: Shadcn/UI with restored previous design
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Supabase Auth
- Type Safety: Full TypeScript integration with improved type definitions

## Component Architecture Review (2025-01-28)

### 📋 **Code Quality Assessment - Risk Area Component**

#### Current Issues Identified:
- ❌ **Monolithic Component**: `RiskArea.tsx` has 873 lines in a single file
- ❌ **Multiple Responsibilities**: Handles zone management, map interaction, modals, forms, and data fetching
- ❌ **Complex State Management**: 15+ useState hooks with interdependencies
- ❌ **Low Reusability**: Tightly coupled components, difficult to extract reusable parts
- ❌ **Testing Challenges**: Large surface area makes unit testing difficult

#### Recommendations for Future Development:
- ✅ **Component Extraction**: Break into focused, single-responsibility components
- ✅ **Custom Hooks**: Extract complex state logic into reusable hooks
- ✅ **Shared Components**: Create reusable EntityCard, CRUDModal, and TabPageLayout patterns
- ✅ **Service Layer**: Continue using the existing service pattern (already implemented well)

#### Documentation Created:
- 📖 **COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive guide for building maintainable components
- 📖 **Prompt Template**: Standardized approach for creating similar complex dashboard pages
- 📖 **Folder Structure**: Recommendations for organizing components by feature vs. shared usage

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Risk Area feature is production-ready with desired UI and full functionality
2. **Future Refactoring**: When time permits, consider refactoring RiskArea.tsx using the architecture guide
3. **New Features**: Use the component architecture guide and prompt template for future dashboard pages
4. **Team Development**: Reference the guide when building similar complex interfaces

## Development Guidelines

- Use playwright mcp for URL checking
- Use supabase mcp for database operations  
- Project uses ES modules in package.json
- Track all significant changes in this STATUS.md file
- **For new complex pages**: Follow patterns in `COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`
- **Component Size**: Keep components under 200 lines when possible
- **Reusability**: Extract shared patterns to `src/components/shared/`
