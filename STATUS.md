## Component Architecture Review (2025-01-28)

### 📋 **Code Quality Assessment - Risk Area Component**

#### Current Issues Identified:
- ❌ **Monolithic Component**: `RiskArea.tsx` has 873 lines in a single file
- ❌ **Multiple Responsibilities**: Handles zone management, map interaction, modals, forms, and data fetching
- ❌ **Complex State Management**: 15+ useState hooks with interdependencies
- ❌ **Low Reusability**: Tightly coupled components, difficult to extract reusable parts
- ❌ **Testing Challenges**: Large surface area makes unit testing difficult

#### Recommendations for Future Development:
- ✅ **Component Extraction**: Break into focused, single-responsibility components
- ✅ **Custom Hooks**: Extract complex state logic into reusable hooks
- ✅ **Shared Components**: Create reusable EntityCard, CRUDModal, and TabPageLayout patterns
- ✅ **Service Layer**: Continue using the existing service pattern (already implemented well)

#### Documentation Created:
- 📖 **COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive guide for building maintainable components
- 📖 **Prompt Template**: Standardized approach for creating similar complex dashboard pages
- 📖 **Folder Structure**: Recommendations for organizing components by feature vs. shared usage

### ✅ **MAJOR REFACTORING COMPLETED** (2025-01-28)

**Successfully broke down the 873-line monolithic `RiskArea.tsx` component:**

#### New Architecture Implemented:
- **Custom Hooks**: `useRiskZones`, `useModalManager`, `useRiskZoneForm`
- **Shared Components**: `TabPageLayout`, `CRUDModal`, `EntityCard`
- **Feature Components**: `ZoneManagementTab`, `MapManagementTab`, `RiskZoneCard`
- **Main Component**: Reduced to ~160 lines, focused on coordination only

#### Benefits Achieved:
- ✅ **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- ✅ **Reusability**: Components can be used across different pages
- ✅ **Testability**: Smaller surface area, easier to unit test
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Changes are isolated and easier to implement
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces throughout

#### Files Created:
- `src/hooks/useRiskZones.ts` - Complete risk zone state management
- `src/hooks/useModalManager.ts` - Centralized modal state management
- `src/hooks/useRiskZoneForm.ts` - Form validation and state management
- `src/components/shared/TabPageLayout.tsx` - Reusable tab layout pattern
- `src/components/shared/CRUDModal.tsx` - Generic CRUD modal component
- `src/components/risk-area/RiskZoneCard.tsx` - Zone display component
- `src/components/risk-area/ZoneManagementTab.tsx` - Zone management tab
- `src/components/risk-area/MapManagementTab.tsx` - Map management tab

### Next Steps
1. **Apply Pattern to Other Pages**: Use these patterns for `Dashboard.tsx`, `Equipment.tsx`, `Maintenance.tsx`
2. **Component Testing**: Add unit tests for the new custom hooks and components
3. **Documentation**: Update team docs with the new modular architecture patterns

## Development Guidelines

- Use playwright mcp for URL checking
- Use supabase mcp for database operations  
- Project uses ES modules in package.json
- Track all significant changes in this STATUS.md file
- **For new complex pages**: Follow patterns in `COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`
- **Component Size**: Keep components under 200 lines when possible
- **Reusability**: Extract shared patterns to `src/components/shared/`
