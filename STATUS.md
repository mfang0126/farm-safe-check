#### Risk Area Database Integration - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Applied Supabase migration for `farm_maps` and `risk_zones` tables
- ‚úÖ Updated Supabase types with proper enum support for risk levels
- ‚úÖ Successfully tested Risk Area feature functionality
- ‚úÖ Verified database integration works correctly

#### Database Migration Applied
- Applied migration: `20250128_create_farm_map_and_risk_zones.sql`
- Created tables:
  - `farm_maps`: Stores farm layout information
  - `risk_zones`: Stores risk area definitions with proper relationships
- Added `risk_level` enum with values: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user data isolation
- Updated TypeScript types to match database schema

#### Testing Results
- ‚úÖ Risk Area page loads successfully with restored UI
- ‚úÖ "Add Risk Zone" modal opens without errors
- ‚úÖ Form validation works correctly
- ‚úÖ Database insertion successful (tested with existing zones)
- ‚úÖ Data displays correctly in the restored UI format
- ‚úÖ All 4 action buttons work correctly: View Details, Edit Info, View on Map, Manage Plan
- ‚úÖ Action plan management functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ Zone positioning and editing fully functional
- ‚úÖ Success notifications work as expected

### Features Working
- User authentication and authorization
- Dashboard navigation
- Equipment management
- Checklists system
- Maintenance scheduling
- **Risk Area Management** (with restored previous UI design + database integration)

### Technical Implementation
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- UI Components: Shadcn/UI with restored previous design
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Supabase Auth
- Type Safety: Full TypeScript integration with improved type definitions

## Component Architecture Review (2025-01-28)

### üìã **Code Quality Assessment - Risk Area Component**

#### Current Issues Identified:
- ‚ùå **Monolithic Component**: `RiskArea.tsx` has 873 lines in a single file
- ‚ùå **Multiple Responsibilities**: Handles zone management, map interaction, modals, forms, and data fetching
- ‚ùå **Complex State Management**: 15+ useState hooks with interdependencies
- ‚ùå **Low Reusability**: Tightly coupled components, difficult to extract reusable parts
- ‚ùå **Testing Challenges**: Large surface area makes unit testing difficult

#### Recommendations for Future Development:
- ‚úÖ **Component Extraction**: Break into focused, single-responsibility components
- ‚úÖ **Custom Hooks**: Extract complex state logic into reusable hooks
- ‚úÖ **Shared Components**: Create reusable EntityCard, CRUDModal, and TabPageLayout patterns
- ‚úÖ **Service Layer**: Continue using the existing service pattern (already implemented well)

#### Documentation Created:
- üìñ **COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive guide for building maintainable components
- üìñ **Prompt Template**: Standardized approach for creating similar complex dashboard pages
- üìñ **Folder Structure**: Recommendations for organizing components by feature vs. shared usage

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Risk Area feature is production-ready with desired UI and full functionality
2. **Future Refactoring**: When time permits, consider refactoring RiskArea.tsx using the architecture guide
3. **New Features**: Use the component architecture guide and prompt template for future dashboard pages
4. **Team Development**: Reference the guide when building similar complex interfaces

## Development Guidelines

- Use playwright mcp for URL checking
- Use supabase mcp for database operations  
- Project uses ES modules in package.json
- Track all significant changes in this STATUS.md file
- **For new complex pages**: Follow patterns in `COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`
- **Component Size**: Keep components under 200 lines when possible
- **Reusability**: Extract shared patterns to `src/components/shared/`
