# Farm Safe Check - Development Status

## Recent Changes

### 2024-01-XX - Interactive Farm Risk Map with Modal System

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ **Installed react-konva and konva** dependencies for interactive canvas
- ✅ **Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces** in `src/types/farmMap.ts`:
  - `RiskZoneData` with database-ready fields for Supabase integration
  - `FarmMapData` with map configuration and bounds
  - `MapInteractionState` for zoom, pan, and selection states
  - `RISK_LEVEL_STYLES` with color schemes for each risk level
- ✅ **Built interactive FarmMap component** using [Konva.js](https://konvajs.org/docs/react/index.html):
  - Canvas-based rendering with zoom and pan functionality
  - Interactive risk zones (rectangles, circles, polygons)
  - Real-time hover and selection states
  - Grid overlay and farm boundary visualization
- ✅ **Enhanced Risk Area page** with full interactivity:
  - Live zone selection synced between map and list views
  - Dynamic zone creation with random positioning
  - Proper event handling for map interactions
- ✅ **Implemented AddRiskZoneModal component**:
  - Professional modal interface following codebase patterns
  - Form validation with required fields
  - Specific risk categories as requested by user:
    * "Loading & Unloading Operations"
    * "Machinery & Equipment Areas"
    * "Livestock Handling Areas"
    * "Storage & Processing Facilities"
    * "Environmental & Weather Hazards"
  - Risk level select field (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
  - Zone name text input
  - Location text input
  - Description & hazards textarea
  - Toast notifications for success/error feedback
  - Proper TypeScript integration with existing interfaces
  - Replaces previous inline form with professional modal pattern

**Interactive Features:**
- **Canvas Map Navigation**: 
  - Mouse wheel zoom (10% to 500%)
  - Drag to pan across farm layout
  - Click empty space to deselect zones
- **Zone Interactions**:
  - Click zones to select and view details
  - Hover effects with visual feedback  
  - Synchronized selection between map and zone list
  - Zone labels with risk-level color coding
- **Visual Elements**:
  - Risk level legend with color indicators
  - Grid overlay for precise positioning
  - Farm boundary with light green background
  - Zoom percentage display
- **Data Integration Ready**:
  - All interfaces include Supabase fields (created_at, updated_at, user_id)
  - Mock data generator with realistic farm zones
  - Form submission adds zones to live map data

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Canvas Performance**: Uses Konva.js for smooth 60fps interactions
- **TypeScript Safety**: Fully typed interfaces for all map data
- **State Management**: React hooks for map interactions and selections
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable canvas size for different screen sizes
- **Mobile Support**: Touch events for mobile/tablet interaction

**Status:** ✅ Complete - Fully Interactive with Database-Ready Architecture
**Next Steps:** 
- **Supabase Integration**: Connect TypeScript interfaces to database tables
- **Advanced Drawing Tools**: Add polygon/shape creation tools
- **GPS Coordinate Support**: Real-world mapping with satellite overlay
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user map editing
- **Export/Import**: Save map configurations and zone data
